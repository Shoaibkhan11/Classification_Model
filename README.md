# Cat and Dog Classifier with Modified VGG16

## Introduction
This project is a binary image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using a modified VGG16 architecture. The modifications aim to enhance the model's performance on this specific task. The repository also includes a Jupyter Notebook for those interested in the model's structure and training process.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a small dataset . The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the VGG16 architecture with custom modifications to better suit the cat and dog classification task. These modifications include making the my own dense layer structure and also instead of using Softmax I have used Sigmoid activation function for the finall classification.
